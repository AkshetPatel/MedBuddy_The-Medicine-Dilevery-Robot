# MedBuddy_The-Medicine-Dilevery-Robot.
The objective of this project MedBuddy is to minimize corona virus cases among the medical staff and doctors when they have to deliver medicines to the patients who are isolated in the general ward. This objective is attained by devising a Bluetooth controlled robot car which is controlled by a smart phone or a tablet and is equipped with a smart phone acts as an eye for the robot. A camera module can also be used for the same
purpose.

## Main Aim:
The main aim of this project MedBuddy is to create a Bluetooth controlled robot car which can be controlled
from at least 50 feet away with the help of an application running on a smart phone.

## Motivation:
With the ever increasing rise in the amount of daily covid-19 positive cases in India, which is almost equal to 1 lakh as of 12-09-2020, there is a need to control the spreading of the virus especially to the doctors and medical staff because they are our life saviors. This bot will prevent the virus from spreading from the infected patients to the nurses or doctors when they have to visit the patient just for delivering medicines as it is a fully contactless system. 

## About the App:
The application which is used to drive the car is created using MIT App Inventor. MIT App inventor is an online platform designed to teach computational thinking concepts through development of mobile applications. Students create applications by dragging and dropping components into a design view and using a visual blocks language to program application behavior.
